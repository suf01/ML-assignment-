## Problem statement

Write a program to read a file containing house prices of 1000 houses based on the number of square feet. Split the data into training data of 80% and test data of 20%, fit the data to a linear regression, and print the mean square error on the test data.

## Dependencies
1. pandas library: For data filtering
2. numpy library: To convert data into mathematically fit values for computation
3. matplotlib library: To plot the data
4. sklearn methods: To implement Linear Regression model

## The model in the given code is developed using Jupyter Note with python libraries
